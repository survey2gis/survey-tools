 * This parser expects one record per line, each record with 0 or more fields.
 * Data that is not in this way (columns) has to be transformed before it can be parsed.

 * Each field (column) must be fully defined (position on line, data type, etc.).

 * Whitespace at the beginning of a field's content will be skipped.
 * Lines that are all whitespace or start with a comment sign will be skipped.

/*
 * This software uses a very simple geometry types system.
 * There are only points, lines and polygons. The surveyor has to
 * make a decision which type to measure in the field.
 * Each type is represented by a "geometry tag" which is a
 * user-definable string that has to appear in a user-definable
 * field (the "tag field"). The tag field name must be specified
 * by the user. If it is not specified, then it is assumed to
 * be NULL, and all measurements in the input file(s) are interpreted
 * as single, unique point measurements.
 *
 * These are the different modes for geometry tagging.
 * Only one mode can be chosen per parser.
 *

 *    Mode "Min" (default mode):
 *    This mode keeps manual work in the field to a minimum.
 #
 *    For complex geometries, i.e. (poly)lines and polygons, the first
 *    vertex measurement of a geometry must be tagged with the corresponding
 *    geometry type. For points, this is optional by default.
 *    For geometry types that consist of more than one vertex, the first
 *    occurrence of the tag marks the start of the geometry.
 *    The end of the geometry is assumed when a new record with full
 *    attribute values is entered (see below).
 *    The attribute values for each geometry are only coded once,
 *    on the line that contains the first vertex. After that, the parser
 *    expects to encounter only coordinate fields and those set to be
 *    "persistent". Persistent fields will be parsed correctly, but their
 *    values will not be stored. Attribute values for the whole geometry
 *    will only be read from the first vertex' record.
 *    To _explicitely_ mark a measurement as the end/closing vertex for
 *    (poly)lines/polygons, take a measurement
 *    at a great distance. Just how great that distance should be can be
 *    defined as part of the parser description (0=disable). There is also
 *    _implicit_ closing of geometries: this happens if (a) the end of the
 *    current input file is reached, (b) a measurement with attribute values
 *    is encountered, but the attribute values are different from those
 *    of the first (opening) vertex.
 *
 *    By default, untagged geometries are read as simple points.
 *
 *    If the parser's "strict" property is set to TRUE, then a geometry tag
 *    must be provided for each first vertex, including points.
 *

/*
 *    Mode "Max":
 *    Assumes complete information about geometry and attributes
 *    in every record. More useful for import of geometry and attribute
 *    descriptions from databases etc. than for actual field surveys.
 *
 *    The geometry type is tagged at the end of each and every record.
 *    that describe all vertices of one geometry. The tag field must be a
 *    separate field that contains only the tag. Vertices that belong 
 *    together share a common value (CASE-SENSITIVE for text fields)
 *    in the key field ("key_field). Thus, in this case, a "key_field" MUST
 *    be set. Otherwise, the parser will not know how to group all vertices
 *    that constitute one geometry.
 *
 *    By default, untagged geometries are read as simple points.
 *    In strict mode, such records will be discarded.
 */
#define PARSER_TAG_MODE_MAX		1


/*
 * 	  Mode "End":
 * 	  This mode is compatible with Archï¿½oCAD. It can be used to process
 *    files in that format.
 *
 *    Geometries are tagged at the end of each of a set of measurements
 *    that describe all vertices of one geometry. The tag field must CONTAIN
 * 	  the tag character(s) as part of its content. But it does not have
 *    to store only the tag. Since only the first vertex' attributes are
 *    stored in the output file's attribute table, it is OK to store the
 *    tag as part of another field's value string. Vertices that belong
 *    together share a common value (CASE-SENSITIVE for text fields)
 *    in the key field ("key_field). Thus, in this case, a "key_field" MUST
 *    be set. Otherwise, the parser will not know how to group all vertices
 *    that constitute one geometry. The attribute table values will be read
 *    from the measurement immediately preceding the geometry-tagged record.
 *    Therefore, the tag will not appear in the attribute table, even if it
 *    is stored in the "key_field".
 *
 *    By default, untagged geometries (i.e. those with an empty tag field
 *    value, but not with a missing tag field!) are read as simple points.
 *    In strict mode, such records will be discarded.
