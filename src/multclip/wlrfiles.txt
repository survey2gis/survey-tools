Format of WLR files:

Vertex is described by 2 floats, e.g.
1.234567 0.000000

Contour (PLINE) is described by 1 integer - number of vertices in it
and then list of vertices, e.g. triangle:
3
1.000000 1.000000
2.000000 1.000000
1.000000 2.000000

Polygon (POLYAREA) is described by 1 integer - number of contours in
it and then list of contours. Note that 1st contour in list must be
counter clockwise oriented ( the outer contour of polygon ),
and next contours must be clockwise oriented ( the holes ).

Set of polygons is described by 1 integer - number of polygons in it
and then list of polygons.

Thus, WLR files describe sets of polygons.
